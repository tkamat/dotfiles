This package is a biblatex style for APA (American Psychological
Association) style compliant documents typeset in LaTeX. It
implements a citation style (apa.cbx) and a references section style
(apa.bbx). The styles are loaded just like any other biblatex
styles but I wouldn't try to use the citation and references styles
separately as they rely on each other, macro-wise, in places.

In this document and in the code, the specific APA requirements are
referred to by the section and (if appropriate) the example number of the
APA Style Guide 6th Edition).

You will need to be using csquotes >= 4.3 and biblatex >= 3.4 The biber
backend for biblatex >= 2.5 is also required. This style will not work
correctly if using bibtex as the backend for biblatex. If you want to take
advantage of the biblatex \DeclareQuotePunctuation facility to enforce the
APA required "American punctuation", you should use the babel package with
the "american" option (see biblatex manual section |3.9.1|). You can of
course use other languages but in such cases, to adhere to APA "American"
punctuation rules (following commas moved inside closing quotes etc.), then
you should set up \DeclareQuotePunctuation yourself as per section 4.7.5 of
the biblatex manual.

You can also use this with apa.cls version 1.3.4 or greater by using the 
"noapacite" class option to that class package (which prevents it from
trying to use plain bibtex with the apacite package).

Please refer first to biblatex-apa.pdf for the main documentation.
